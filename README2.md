Hello there.
Seems like your presence here wasn't acknowledged by the community - that's changed right now! :)

Welcome to steemit!

For your security, have a look at piston-cli, that's a python command line tool which allows you to use a custom rpc endpoint (steemd) to post. You're not really required to use the website.

I'm sure they did. They asked for a hidden service on twitter though, and we can't provide that for now.

KEK...
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
Looks like this Russian hackers might actually be Kekistani.

Thinking about it... I think that actually statement:
"Kekistani shitposters and hackers named 4chan made Trump win the elections",
makes way more sense than:
"Russian paid trolls and hackers named Феликс Эдмундович (Felix Dzerzhinsky) hacked the elections"

Hi Shadowbrokers,
Are you sitting on a cache of 0-days for MacOS and Linux as well? Asking for a friend.
